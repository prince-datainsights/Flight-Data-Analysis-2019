The objective of this analysis is to extract actionable insights related to flight distributions, pricing trends, and travel patterns.
The project explores various analytical questions, including:
* Distribution of flights by number of stops
* Identification of the most expensive and cheapest flight categories
* Price variations across source cities
* Flight frequency by day and month
* Impact of additional services on ticket pricing.
